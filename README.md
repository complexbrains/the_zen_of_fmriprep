Just a place to make things simpler to understand for any others out there might have been confused like me while learning thyself.


In the making but just to indicate, I am neither an expert nor claiming to be the one. I am just an ECR, trying to make a science that is reproducable and as correct as possible, following the guidelines, but feeling alone along the way and struggle as many does, and maybe feel insecure with all the complexities the tools and academia brings with itself. Here I will try to reflect what I learnt, what it meant, why it matters as much as time allows.

Sigh...
