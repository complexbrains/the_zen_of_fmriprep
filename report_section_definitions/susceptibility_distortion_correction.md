### Susceptibility distortion correction: 

The functional images can have some warping or distortion due to inhomogeneities in the magnetic field. (fMRIPrep has several options to try to estimate the displacement map)[https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sdc.html], based either on command-line arguments or automatic selection based on the available data). 
This section of the report shows the participantâ€™s functional images before and after distortion correction, with the GM/WM boundary from the anatomical images overlaid as reference using the field maps applied to the functional run.
