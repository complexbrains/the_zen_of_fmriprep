### Alignment of functional and anatomical MRI data (surface driven):

The text tells you which method fMRIPrep used to align the functional and anatomical data - for example, by running `bbregister`. The images show the registered BOLD reference with the white and pial surfaces overlaid (red and blue lines). 

Mouse over to transition back and forth between "fixed" and "moving". Fixed displays the red and blue lines of the Freesurfer surfaces on the anatomical image. Moving displays the functional that has been aligned to the structural while retaining the red and blue lines of the grey matter and white matter surface from the anatomical.

Depending on your bold sequence, you may not be able to make out much, but you should still be able to see the grey matter / white matter boundary. Make sure that this boundary follows the blue line and internal structures well aligned.
