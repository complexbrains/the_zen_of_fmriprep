### BOLD Summary: 

Contains time series (signal) plots of each voxel over time, that covers all the tissue types, such as global signal (GS), global signal of CSF (GSCSF), global signal of white matter (GSWM), and two measures of motion DVARS and framewise displacement (FD).

The rows are color codded that refers to the tissue types, following as blue refers to the cortical gray matter regions, the orange color refers to the subcortical gray matter, green rows refers to the tissues from cerebellum and the red rows refer to the the union of white-matter and CSF compartments.


So look at the big spikes, look at the framewise displacement (FD) and if you see a huge spike then look at the carpet plot. It will also show that right after the spike it will be showing a sustaining columns of pattern (horizontal pattern) for some time points. So you will also see that the sustaining pattern of noise in the carpet plot shows differing pattern across the rows that are matched with the color codded tissue types.
